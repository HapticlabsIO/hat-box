# Welcome to a collection of haptic authoring tools

This site contains information on a variety of different haptic authoring tools ranging from SDKs to complete environments.
While most address the control of vibrotactile devices, force feedback and temperature control are features of some tools as well.

This collection is meant to provide high-level information on a large number of tools with links to more information whenever possible.
This is to help people determine what is already available, and especially if it can be used or reused in their own work to avoid "reinventing the wheel".
High-level information on user interfaces and interactions also is meant to help the designers of new tools identify trends that could inform their own work.
Finally, this collection aims to encourage projects to publicly archive their work in some way, such as through open source software and hardware, especially as a project ends.
More information about this project can be found on the [FAQ page]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq).

To understand the information recorded for each tool in this collection, please consult the [Tool Information page]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/information).

To see the list of tools, go to the [Tools page]({{ site.baseurl }}/tools/) or search for a particular tool in the search bar.
