# Welcome to the {{site.longtitle}}

This site contains information on a variety of different haptic authoring tools, ranging from SDKs to complete interactive environments.
While most address the control of vibrotactile devices, some tools address force feedback and temperature control.

{{site.title}} is intended to provide high-level information on a large number of haptic authoring tools with links to more information when possible.
This is to make it easier to find tools that may be useful, especially if they can be used or modified far more easily than creating an entirely new tool.
High-level information, especially that related to a tool's user interfaces or interactions, may help designers of new tools find ideas and trends relevant to other projects.
Finally, this collection aims to encourage authoring tool creators to publicly archive their work in some way, such as through open source software and hardware, especially as a project ends.
More information about this project can be found on the [FAQ page]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq).

To understand the information recorded for each tool in this collection, please consult the [Tool Information page]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/information).

To see the list of tools, go to the [Tools page]({{ site.baseurl }}/tools/) or use the search bar.
