# Welcome to the {{site.longtitle}}

This site contains information on a variety of different haptic authoring tools (HATs), ranging from SDKs to complete interactive environments.
While most support designing for and controlling vibrotactile devices, some tools do include support for force feedback and temperature control.

{{site.title}} is intended to provide high-level information on a large number of these haptic authoring tools to aid in searching for and making comparisons between them.
While most people would likely search for a tool to directly use, {{site.title}} also aims to be useful to those who want to create new tools by collecting information from a variety of sources and establishing a high-level taxonomy to aid in description and comparison.
This project also provides a place for creators to archive and link to additional information on their work to maximize its utility, even if active development of their tool ends.

More information about {{site.title}}and its goals can be found on the [FAQ page]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq).

To see the current list of entries, go to the [Tools page]({{ site.baseurl }}/tools/) or use the search bar.

For more information about the taxonomy, please consult the [Tool Information page]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/information).
