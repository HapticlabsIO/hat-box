# Welcome to a collection of haptic authoring tools

This site contains information on a variety of different haptic authoring tools with a focus on vibrotactile tools.
Along with these vibrotactile tools, force feedback and temperature control are features of some tools as well.
This was created to serve the dual purpose of helping people looking for a suitable existing authoring tool to find one, and of helping people aiming to create an authoring tool to understand the current landscape before starting.

To understand the information recorded for each tool in this collection, please consult the [Tool Information page]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/information).

To see the list of tools, go to the [Tools page]({{ site.baseurl }}/tools/) or search for a particular tool in the search bar.

Information about this project itself can be found on the [FAQ page]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq).
