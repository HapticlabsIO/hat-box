The TouchCon Editor is meant to design tactile effects for use in instant messaging.
Effects can be created using multiple supported output devices, each described to the system using an XML file, by arranging individual sensations along a timeline.
These can be sent to other users of TouchCon if they have the necessary hardware to display the effect.
