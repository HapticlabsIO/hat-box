mHIVE is a haptic instrument where the user interacts with a tablet's touchscreen to create vibrotactile output over audio.
Most of the screen is devoted to a region where frequency is mapped to the touch along the x-axis and amplitude is mapped to the y-axis.
Sine, square, sawtooth, and triangle waveforms can be selected in a menu below this.
An attack-decay-sustain-release (ADSR) envelope can be modified by dragging the different points of its visualization.
Effects created with mHIVE can be recorded and played back later.
