Vivitouch is meant to support prototyping of vibrotactile haptics aligned to audio-visual content.
Haptic media is created through the use of waveforms and filters mapping the audio content at that moment of time to the vibrotactile channel.
These filters, such as a low-pass filter, are meant to aid in synchronizing audio and haptic content.
Effects and filters are assigned to different output channels, representing each actuator, and to different haptic tracks.
Using multiple tracks allows for layering effects and filters on the same actuator at the same time.
