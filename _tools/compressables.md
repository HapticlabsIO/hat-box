The Compressables Haptic Designer is a web app for controlling the Compressables family of pneumatic wearables.
Motor power limits can be set through the app and gestures in the user interface allow for a user to control compression and decompression in real time.
Time-based effects can also be created and triggered by certain physical gestures.

For more information on Compressables or the Compressables Haptic Designer, please consult the [DIS'21 paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3461778.3462057) or the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/The-Hybrid-Atelier/Compressables-Prototyping-Toolkit).
