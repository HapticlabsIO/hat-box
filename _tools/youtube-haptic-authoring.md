This authoring tool allows for users to annotate YouTube videos with time-synchronized vibrotactile content. The resulting augmented file can be played using a custom browser, written in Java, that supports the specified haptic devices. In the editing environment, the timing and actuation of a vibrotactile array can be set with the source YouTube video visible as a reference.
