Cobity is a Unity plugin for controlling a cobot in VR.
The robot's end effector and position tracking parameters can be modified within the plugin.
The end effector can be moved in response to user movements, e.g., by hand tracking, and can be bound to the position of a virtual object in the scene.

For more information on Cobity, please consult the [MuC'22 paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3543758.3543775) or the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/xteeven/Cobity).
