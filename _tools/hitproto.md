HITPROTO uses a visual programming interface to let users specify the content and behavior of an interactive haptic scene.
Basic programming functionality, such as loops and conditional logic, are included in the environment.
Basic haptic interactions (e.g., spring effects, guidance along a path) are present to aid a user in creating haptic data visualizations.

For more information, consult the [2010 Haptics Symposium paper](https://doi.org/10.1109/HAPTIC.2010.5444647).
