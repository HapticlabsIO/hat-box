The TECHTILE Toolkit consists of a vibrotactile recorder and actuator that allows users to record real-world vibrations and then play them back.
This is meant to permit the sharing of effects by users without strong technical backgrounds, including elementary school children.

For more information, consult the [VRIC'12 article](https://doi.org/10.1145/2331714.2331745)
and the [TECHTILE Toolkit website](http://www.techtile.org/en/techtiletoolkit/).The TECHTILE Toolkit was also used in the [CHI'21 Extended Abstract](https://doi.org/10.1145/3411763.3451640).
