H3D API is a framework that lets users design haptic scenes using X3D.
Virtual objects, effects in space, and haptic devices can be specified using X3D and added into the scene-graph.
Visual properties are rendered using OpenGL and haptic properties are rendered using the included HAPI engine.
Users also have the option of adding new features or creating more complex scenes by directly programming in C++ or Python.

For more information on H3D API, please consult the [H3D API website](https://h3d.org) and its [documentation page](https://h3d.org/documentation/).
