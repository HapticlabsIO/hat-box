Syntacts is an API and graphical tool for creating audio-driven vibrotactile arrays.
Vibrotactile "signals" can be created using common waveforms and combined using operations such as sequencing and multiplication.
Complex envelopes can also be applied to these different signals.
The Syntacts GUI includes a spatializer for mapping desired signals to the correct virtual location on an array and a track-based sequencer to aid in performing these signal operations.
