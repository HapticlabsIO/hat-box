Users of Ubitile wear a vibrotactile actuator and gyroscope on their pointer finger.
Vibration patterns are created by moving this finger between three points: A, B and C.
The pitch angle between positions B and A controls intensity, the time spent travelling between positions A and B controls duration, and the time spent between positions B and C controls the gap time between vibration units.
Patterns are recorded and can be played back as wanted.
