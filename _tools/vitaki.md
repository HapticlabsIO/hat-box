VITAKI supports controlling ERM motors in various configurations.
A photo of the output device's configuration can be loaded into VITAKI and annotated with the locations of each actuator.
Waveforms, either preset or customized through a keyframe-based editor, are assigned to each actuator by placing them in a track corresponding to one actuator.
There is also an additional mode to change the mapping between the waveform values and the actual output voltages sent to the device.
