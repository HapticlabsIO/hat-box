The Pebble smartwatches contain vibration motors that can be controlled through the C API, now maintained by the Rebble project.
On-off vibration patterns can be programmed using the Vibes API where the duration of each on or off interval is specified.

For more information, consult the [Rebble project site](https://rebble.io).
