Weirding Haptics is a design tool for and within virtual reality environments where vocalizations are mapped to vibration patterns attached to virtual objects.
Vocalizations are recorded and mapped to vibration patterns felt when touching the object.
These patterns can have parameters such as maximum amplitude modulated based on the position or velocity of contact.
Several patterns can be layered over each other to create more complex effects impossible to accomplish through one recording.
