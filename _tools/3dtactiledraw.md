3DTactileDraw supports control of an a 24-actuator array using the HapticHead helmet.
Two major interfaces are present in the tool: a paint interface that permits drawing desired effects directly on the surface of a model of a 3D head, and a curve interface that provides per-actuator intensity keyframes on a timeline.
