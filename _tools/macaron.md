Macaron uses web audio to drive an actuator connected to the user's computer.
A library of vibrotactile effects are available for playback that are visualized as waveforms expressing amplitude and frequency over time.
These presets can be loaded into the editor pane where keyframes can be added to the waveforms and modified.
Alternatively, effects can be created from scratch without the use of a preset.
Preset and custom effects can be played back over audio output to support an iterative design process.
