Feellustrator is a design tool for ultrasound mid-air haptics that allows users to sketch out paths for sensations to follow, control how the focal point will move along this path, and combine them together over time to create more complex experiences.
Audio and visual reference materials can be loaded into the tool, but cannot be modified once added.
Hand tracking support is present so that effects can be played relative to the user's hand rather than floating freely in space.

For more information, please consult the [CHI'23 paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3544548.3580728).
