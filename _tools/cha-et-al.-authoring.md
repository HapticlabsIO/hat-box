The authoring tool described by Cha et al. is meant to create interactions to be broadcast using MPEG-4 Binary Format for Scenes (BIFS).
Haptic effects are represented through different "nodes" that support moving a force-feedback device along a trajectory, guiding a force-feedback device to a specific position, and triggering vibration on a tactile array.
The tool itself supports recording motion on a force-feedback device for use in these nodes and an interface for creating and aligning vibration effects with pre-existing video files.
