ANISMA is a toolkit to prototype wearable haptic devices using shape-memory alloys (SMAs).
Users can position types of SMAs already present in the software between two nodes and simulate how networks of SMAs would behave on the skin during actuation.
Nodes to which SMAs are attached can either be simulated as adhered to the skin of the wearer or free-floating.
Once the layout is complete, ANISMA can be used to fabricate the design and to play back patterns on the actual hardware.
