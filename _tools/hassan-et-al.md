Hassan, Abdulali, and Jeon created an affective authoring space for textures based on 25 models of real materials.
These were positioned on an affective space defined by two axes, hard-soft and rough-smooth.
New models can be generated interpolated from the original data-driven models and played back on a voice-coil actuator, such as the Haptuator Mark II.
