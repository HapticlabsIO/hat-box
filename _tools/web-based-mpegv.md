Dong et al.'s authoring tool allows for friction, sping, impulse, and shape forces to be added to 3D objects loaded into the editing environment. The resulting elements are exported using a proposed extension of MPEG-V to support haptics.

For more information, consult the [2013 IEEE International Symposium on Haptic Audio Visual Environments and Games paper](10.1109/HAVE.2013.6679616) and the [2015 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia paper](https://doi.org/10.1109/ISM.2015.71).
