H-Studio is a tool meant to add haptic effects, primarily motion effects, to a pre-existing video file.
Its primary interface provides a preview of the original audio-visual content, tracks of the different parameters that can be edited in H-Studio, and a visual preview of a selected motion effect.
Data to drive a motion effect can be input from a force-feedback device directly or from another source (e.g., an IMU), and motion effects can be played back in the tool to aid in further refinement.
