This system is a Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) plugin that adds force-feedback effects to a subset of VRML.
This means that existing VRML scenes can automatically have haptic effects added to them.
The scene can be explored using a PHANTOM device in the Netscape browser.

For more information about the VRML plugin, consult the [2003 Haptics Symposium paper](https://doi.org/10.1109/HAPTIC.2003.1191334).
