While Voodle is primarily meant to control 1 DoF robots called "CuddleBits", it can also be used for haptic prototyping.
The frequency and amplitude of a user's voice is used to drive the output of the system.
Each parameter is normalized and used to create a weighted average with the bias value set by the user.
The user can then add random noise to the system and scale and smooth the resulting output.
The mapping of voice input to motor output occurs in real time.
