Beadbox allows users to place and connect beads across different tracks, representing different physical actuators.
Each bead provides a visual representation of vibration frequency and intensity.
Duration can be controlled by forming a connection across two beads.
If actuator, duration, or frequency changes between the beads, Beadbox will move between these values during playback.

For more information about Beadbox, consult the [UAHCI 2016 paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-40244-4_5) and the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/somang/TheBeadbox).
