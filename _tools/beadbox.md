Beadbox allows users to place and connect beads across different tracks, representing different physical actuators.
Each bead provides a visual representation of vibration frequency and intensity.
Duration can be controlled by forming a connection across two beads.
If actuator, duration, or frequency changes between the beads, Beadbox will move between these values during playback.
