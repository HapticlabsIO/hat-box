Lofelt Studio allows users to load an audio file into the tool.
This automatically creates an initial vibrotactile experience.
This can be refined through controls in the editor itself, such as menus controlling global parameters and using keyframes to control the waveforms directly.
These editing processes can also be used to create effects from scratch.
Vibrotactile effects can be sent to iOS and Android devices with a corresponding Lofelt Studio app installed.

For more information, consult the [Lofelt website](https://lofelt.com).
