The DrawOSC and Pattern Player tools were used to compose tactile effects with the eccentric rotating mass (ERM) motors present on the arms, legs, and torso of the Ilinx garment.
DrawOSC provides a visual representation of the body and allows the user to draw vibration trajectories that are played on the garment and to adjust a global vibration intensity parameter.
The Pattern Player tool additionally allows for intensity to be controlled independently over these trajectories.
