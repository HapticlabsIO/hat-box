The posVibEditor supports the creation of vibration patterns across multiple ERM motors.
Vibration assets can be created by manipulating keyframes in a vibration intensity over time visualization.
These assets, or provided templates, can be copied into a track interface to decide which motor each will be displayed on and at what time.
A "perceptually transparent rendering" mode is included to adjust the mapping of asset amplitude values to output voltage values so that the authored effect is felt as intended.
