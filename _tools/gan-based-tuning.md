The tuning method developed here uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) to produce vibrations corresponding to materials with properties in between those provided in the dataset used to train the GAN. The application described in the paper was intended to test this method of haptic tuning with users.

For more information about this method, consult the [2020 IEEE Access paper](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2968185).
