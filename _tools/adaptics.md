AdapTics is a toolkit for creating ultrasound tactons whose parameters change in response to other parameters or events.
It consists of two components: the AdapTics Engine and Designer. The Designer, built on Unity, allows for the creation of adaptive tactons using elements commonly found in audio-video editors, and adaptive audio editing in particular. Tactons can be created freely or in relation to a simulated hand. The Designer communicates using WebSockets to the Engine, which is responsible for rendering on the connected hardware. While only Ultraleap devices are supported as of writing, the Engine is designed to support future hardware. The Engine can be used directly through API calls in Rust or C/C++.
