HapticPilot allows for users to sketch haptic patterns on their hands in virtual reality. When patterns are played back, an algorithm that accounts for differences in hand posture is used so that patterns feel the same even as the user moves. A glove containing 12 actuators and 13 accelerometers is used to track hand movement and render recorded patterns.
