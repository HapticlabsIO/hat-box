The Interhaptics Haptic Composer focuses on the creation of different materials for VR.
Vibration can be added to a material by adding different regular waveforms and constants together.
The "texture" menu functions in the same way, except that the resulting waveform is rendered statically over position to create bumps and changes in elevation.
The "stiffness" menu determines the amount of force returned given the amount of displacement into the material.
A fourth "thermal" option exists, but cannot be modified at this time.
