HaptiDesigner is a toolkit to create vibrotactile patterns or *Haptograms* on multiple actuators.
Each Haptogram is composed of multiple frames that each specify which actuators are activated in that frame ,the intensity of vibration, the duration, and the pause between the end of that frame and the following one.
These patterns are stored in a local database so they can be modified and reused.
