Feel Messenger is a haptically augmented text messaging application structured around families of "feel effects".
Feel widgets or "feelgits" are types of effects that can be varied by a set of parameters, or "feelbits".
These parameters are made available to users of Feel Messenger through a set of menus.
New effects can also be created by playing pre-existing effects one after the other.
