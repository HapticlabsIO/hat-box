VibEd is designed to create vibrotactile feedback for games.
A waveform editing interface is present in the tool where keyframes can be used to control the duration and intensity of vibration patterns to be displayed on the selected output device.
If a playback application is installed on the desired platform, the editor can send authored patterns to it at runtime.
