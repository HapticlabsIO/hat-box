HFX studio allows for authoring haptic effects directly on the body or attaching them to objects in a VR environment.
Perceptual models are used to encode and render the desired effects to the extent supported by the connected hardware.
This intermediate perceptual layer is intended to separate the design of haptic effects from the devices used to display them.
