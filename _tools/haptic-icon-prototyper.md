The Haptic Icon Prototyper consists of a waveform editor used to adjust the magnitude of a force-feedback effect over position or time.
Waveforms can be refined by manipulating keyframes on visualizations of them and adjusting until a desired result is achieved.
These waveforms can then be combined together in a timeline either by superimposing them to create a new tile or by sequencing them.
The combination of these features is meant to support the user in rapidly brainstorming new ideas.
