HAMLAT is an extension to Blender that adds additional menu items to control the static physical properties of modeled objects. These properties can be felt using a force feedback device in the environment itself.
These properties can be imported to and exported from HAMLAT using the Haptic Applications Meta Language (HAML).

For more information, consult the [EuroHaptics 2008 paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-69057-3_108).
