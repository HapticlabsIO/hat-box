TactTongue is an app and prototyping kit to explore electrotactile stimulation on the tongue.
The parameters of the signal on each electrode can be directly controlled, or presets can be used as the basis for a design. A visualization of the resulting sensation on the tongue is shown in the application, and the pattern itself can be played on a connected TactTongue device.

For more information about TactTongue, consult the [2023 UIST paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3586183.3606829) and the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/difflab-ucalgary/TactTongue).
