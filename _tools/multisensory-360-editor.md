The multisensory 360° video editor allows for such video files to be loaded and augmented with additional sounds and with new haptic and olfactory content synchronized to certain times in the video.
Low frequency vibration and airflow from different directions around the viewer can be controlled using the application.

For more information about the editor, consult the [2018 World Conference on Information Systems and Technologies paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-77712-2_30).
