The bHaptics Designer allows for tactile patterns and animations to be created on the various bHaptics products worn on the body.
Points of vibration can be set to move across the grid of the selected device with intensity changing from waypoint to waypoint.
Individual paths can be placed into tracks on a timeline to create layered, more complex effects.

For more information, consult the [bHaptics Designer website](https://designer.bhaptics.com/).
