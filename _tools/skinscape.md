Skinscape is meant to be a haptic equivalent to a MIDI sequencer.
Keyboard inputs are recorded in Max/MSP and mapped to seven haptic actuators, six of which are located on the arms and one on the lower back.
This sequence would then be exported and loaded into a traditional audio editing environment (e.g., ProTools) so that it can be combined with existing music.
