MHaptic and its associated Haptic Scene Creator allows for augmenting virtual reality 3D models so they can be interacted with using a bimanual force-feedback device. The underlying MHaptic library can be used directly, or the Creator can be used to load 3D models, generate haptic geometries for them, and manually adjust the resulting elements.

For more information about MHaptic and the Haptic Scene Creator, consult the [2007 International Conference on Cyberworlds paper](https://doi.org/10.1109/CW.2007.54).
