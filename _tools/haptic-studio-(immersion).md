Haptic Studio supports the creation of several kinds of base effects either from scratch or from a WAV file.
These base effects can be of types MagSweep (continuous vibration along an attack-sustain-release or ASR envelope), Periodic (regular pulses that are contained in an ASR envelope), or Waveform (statically loaded from a WAV file).
They can be assigned to a timeline element where they can be linked to different actuators, arranged in time, and have their applicable parameters modified.
Individual effects ("components") and timelines can be played back, refined, and exported when complete.

For more information, consult the [Immersion website](https://www.immersion.com/).
