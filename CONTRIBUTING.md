How to contribute depends on how you want to improve the project.

Do you want to:
* [suggest a new tool?](#suggesting-a-new-tool)
* [provide a correction?](#correcting-an-added-tool)
* [fix or report a bug?](#bug-fixes-on-the-website)

## Suggesting a New Tool

If you have or know of a tool that you think should be part of HAT Box, please suggest it to the project.
How to go about this depends on if you are able to complete information on the tool based on the [classification system](https://srl.mcgill.ca/hat-box/docs/information.html)
and provide a short written description of the tool.

If you can add the content for the new page yourself (preferred):
* [Open a Pull Request](https://github.com/JRegimbal/hat-box/pulls) on GitHub creating the new page; or
* Fill out the [new tool request form](https://forms.office.com/r/Rt5MHFdagf).

If you can't add the content for the new page, you can still:
* [Create a new Issue](https://github.com/JRegimbal/hat-box/issues/new) on GitHub;
* Fill out the [new tool request form](https://forms.office.com/r/Rt5MHFdagf), leaving the second section blank; or
* Email @JRegimbal directly at juliette *dot* regimbal *at* mail.mcgill.ca.

## Corrections to an Added Tool

Did we get something wrong? Has something changed?
Let us know what you think should be changed and the reason for the change by either:

* [Creating a new Issue](https://github.com/JRegimbal/hat-box/issues/new) on GitHub; or
* Emailing @JRegimbal directly at juliette *dot* regimbal *at* mail.mcgill.ca.

## Changes/Clarification on the Classification System

Do you think there should be other information in the tool summary tables?
Does something seem confusing or inconsistent?
Please create a new post in the [Discussions](https://github.com/JRegimbal/hat-box/discussions) section under "Ideas" or "Q&A" as appropriate.

If the result of this discussion requires changes to the project, a new issue or issues will be created then.

## Bug Fixes on the Website

If something is not working right, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/JRegimbal/hat-box/issues/new)
so that everyone knows what is going on.
If you have a fix that you would like applied to the site, then [create a pull request](https://github.com/JRegimbal/hat-box/pulls) indicating what is wrong and how your changes resolve the problem.

## New Features on the Website

For significant changes to the website or new functionality, please create a new [discussion](https://github.com/JRegimbal/hat-box/discussions) under the "Ideas" category.
Issues and pull requests are appreciated after once a clear aproach is identified and the feature is confirmed to be in scope for HAT Box.

## All Other Contributions

If you're interested in contributing anything else, please either create a new [discussion](https://github.com/JRegimbal/hat-box/discussions) or email @JRegimbal at juliette *dot* regimbal *at* mail.mcgill.ca.
Just because what you have in mind was not thought of when this page was written does not mean it is not appreciated!
